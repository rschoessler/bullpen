# Bullpen Pitch Charting
Let's create an app that allows you to track every pitch your players throw from bullpens to live BP to live game action

Some things it should do:
- Track a pitcher's progress over time
-- Who?
-- Date?
-- Type of bullpen?  Command? Intent?  Live BP?  Game warmups?  Game live pitches?
- Describe the bullpen
-- Flat? Mound? Indoor?  Outdoor?  Batter present?  (multi-select)
